# SimpleStats
A no-bullshit in-game stats viewer.

Replaces the default /stats command with a much more informative text-based version:  
![Stats Image 1](https://i.imgur.com/8znoeTO.png)  
You can also get stats for a specific game (`/stats [player] [game]`):

As of 1.1, you can get stats for a player's guild too (`/stats [player] guild`):

## Shortcuts
- Use `:` before a name to get stats compactly in one line. (`/stats :[player] <game/guild>`)
- Use `.` instead of a name to check your own stats easily. (`/stats . <game/guild>`)
- Use `*` instead of a name to enter server mode and get stats of everyone on the current server upto 24 players. (`/stats * <game/guild>`)

## Installation
1. Download from the [releases page](https://github.com/mew/SimpleStats/releases)
2. Put jar into your mods folder
3. When in game, set your Hypixel API key with /setkey
