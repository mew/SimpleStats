A no-bullshit in-game stats viewer.

Replaces the default /stats command with a much more informative text-based version:

You can also get stats for a specific game (`/stats [player] [game]`):

As of 1.1, you can get stats for a player's guild too (`/stats [player] guild`):

As of 1.3, you can get stats for everyone in your lobby (`/stats * [game]`):

## Shortcuts
- Use `:` before a name to get stats compactly in one line. (`/stats :[player] <game/guild>`)
- Use `.` instead of a name to check your own stats easily. (`/stats . <game/guild>`)
- Use `*` instead of a name to enter server mode and get stats of everyone on the current server upto 24 players. (`/stats * <game/guild>`)

## Installation
1. Download from the [releases page](https://github.com/mew/SimpleStats/releases)
